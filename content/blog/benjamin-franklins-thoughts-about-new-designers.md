**When I look back to how life was some years ago, I can’t believe how much things have changed and, most important, what that change means. I have realized that we often see change as something bad, perhaps because it is the traditional way to think about it. Still, change can mean much more than that, you learn about the past, about how things were, and that is what really matters. To develop an awareness of what we are doing to live the life we want to remember someday, to be aware that sometimes we fall for one reason: to rise.**

 **Life is unpredictable, and the mystery behind staying alive is something that I cannot get out of my mind. Every night I wonder why I am here, in this world, what is my purpose or what is the purpose of all humanity, and why are we here? And interestingly, those questions are so common for people, and usually we give them a superficial meaning even when we know that they are the key to understanding what we are living for.**

 **And maybe you think that I’m crazy or that I don’t have something better to do, but it is not the case. I just consider it is important to think, from time to time, about what we are doing and reflect on if we are doing what we really want to do because at the end of our lives, the only thing we’re going to take with us are our memories, the laughs that are in our hearts and the moments that we spent with those who we love.**
